# Estimating Work for Azure AI Document Intelligence

Below is a breakdown of the key aspects to consider:

---

## 1. **Scope and Complexity of Documents**
   - **Variety of Document Types**: Determine how many different types of documents (invoices, receipts, identity documents, etc.) you need to process.
   - **Volume of Documents**: Estimate the total number of documents to be processed on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis.
   - **Languages**: Determine the languages present in the documents.
   - **Output Requirements**: Define the required data outputs (e.g., raw text, structured data, key-value pairs, tables).
   - **Structure Variability**: Consider whether documents have a consistent layout or if each type has variations.
   - **Volume of Fields and Tables**: More fields, tables, or key-value pairs increase complexity.

---

## 2. **Project Scope**
  - **Data Labeling Needs**: If custom models are required, estimate the time and resources needed for labeling training data.
   - **Integration Requirements**: Identify the systems or workflows the solution will integrate with (e.g., ERP, CRM, RPA tools).
- **Prebuilt vs. Custom Models**:
  - **Prebuilt Models** often require minimal configuration but are limited to specific document types.
  - **Custom Models** need labeled training data and time to iteratively refine models.
- **Labeling Effort**: If creating custom models, estimate how much effort is needed to label documents for training.

---

## 3. **Technical Considerations**
- **Data Preparation**: Evaluate the effort required to prepare documents for processing (e.g., scanning, cleaning).
- **API Usage**: Plan for API integrations and usage limits based on the estimated volume.
- **Scalability**: Determine if the solution will need to scale for peak workloads.
- **Error Handling**: Account for error handling, retries, and exception workflows.
- **Data Security**: Ensure compliance with data privacy and security requirements.
- **Document Quality**: Blurry or skewed scans, handwritten data, and low-resolution images can affect accuracy.
- **Language and Localization**: Ensure that languages in your documents are supported. Some languages may need specialized handling.
- **Data Cleaning Requirements**: Additional preprocessing or post-processing might be necessary for noisy data.
- **Number of Documents**: High volumes may require scaling considerations and can impact cost significantly.
- **Concurrent Processing**: Determine if you need real-time or batch processing and how many documents need to be processed simultaneously.
- **Performance Requirements**: Identify SLAs or expectations around turnaround times.

## 4. **Development Effort**
   - **Model Customization**: Estimate time for creating and training custom models.
   - **Integration Development**: Plan the effort required to integrate Azure AI Document Intelligence with other systems.
   - **Workflow Automation**: Determine the complexity of automating document processing workflows.
   - **Testing**: Allocate time for testing accuracy and performance.
   - **Optimization**: Account for iterative improvements based on feedback.
- **Application Architecture**: Consider how Document Intelligence integrates with your existing systems, databases, or applications.
- **API Calls and Orchestration**: Estimate engineering effort to develop and maintain pipelines (e.g., Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions).
- **Security and Compliance**: Additional work may be needed to ensure compliance with data protection standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).

- **Accuracy Requirements**: How precise must the extracted data be? Higher accuracy typically means more model tuning and test cycles.
- **QA/Testing Resources**: Plan for iterative testing to validate extraction results and refine models.
- **Pilot/Proof of Concept**: Building a pilot phase can help identify unknown complexities before full rollout.

## 5. **Infrastructure and Cost Considerations**
   - **Azure Resource Setup**: Consider time for setting up Azure services (e.g., Azure Form Recognizer, storage, compute).
   - **Resource Scaling**: Plan for potential scaling needs based on document volume.
   - **Cost Estimation**:
     - Calculate costs for processing documents using the Azure pricing calculator.
       - **Prebuilt Models**: Charged per page processed.
       - **Custom Models**: Includes charges for training, storage, and processing.

- **Azure Pricing Model**: Review the **pay-as-you-go** pricing based on the number of pages/documents processed.
- **Storage and Network**: Factor in storage costs for documents and potential data transfer fees.
- **Development and Maintenance**:
  - **Initial Setup**: Model configuration, custom model training, and integration can incur upfront costs.
  - **Ongoing Tuning**: Periodic retraining and maintenance may be required if document formats or content change over time.
- **Azure Consumption Estimates**: Use the Azure Calculator to project costs for your expected volume.

   - **Support**: Plan for ongoing support and troubleshooting.

## 9. Risks and Mitigations
- **Model Drift**: Document formats or standards may change over time, requiring updates to custom models.
- **Data Security**: Sensitive or confidential documents require robust security measures to protect data in transit and at rest.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Certain industries have strict data processing regulations; plan for audits and compliance checks.

## Example Questions to Ask Stakeholders
   - What is the format and structure of the documents to be processed?
   - How many documents will need to be processed per day/month?
   - Are there any specific compliance or security requirements?
   - What level of accuracy is expected?
