# Features of Azure AI Document Intelligence

Azure AI Document Intelligence (formerly Azure Form Recognizer) is a service designed to extract information from documents using AI and machine learning. It helps automate data processing workflows and makes it easier to extract key insights from unstructured documents.

## Key Features

### 1. **Prebuilt Models**
   - Supports a variety of common document types, such as:
     - Invoices
     - Receipts
     - Business cards
     - Identity documents (e.g., passports, driverâ€™s licenses)
     - Tax forms
   - Extracts structured data such as names, dates, addresses, totals, and more.

### 2. **Custom Models**
   - Allows training custom models on user-specific document layouts and formats.
   - Useful for industry-specific or proprietary forms and documents.

### 3. **Layout Extraction**
   - Extracts the raw text, structure, and layout information, including tables, lines, words, and bounding boxes.
   - Helps analyze and digitize documents while preserving their visual structure.

### 4. **Key-Value Pair Extraction**
   - Automatically identifies and extracts key-value pairs from forms and documents.
   - Ideal for extracting information such as form fields and responses.

### 5. **Table Recognition**
   - Accurately detects and extracts data from tables, even when they span multiple pages or are complex.
   - Maintains the structure of tabular data for easy processing.

### 6. **Document Classification**
   - Classifies documents into categories based on their content.
   - Useful for sorting and organizing incoming documents automatically.

### 7. **Multi-Language Support**
   - Supports multiple languages for text extraction, enabling global use cases.

### 8. **Scalability**
   - Processes large volumes of documents efficiently, scaling up or down based on business needs.
   - Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services like Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and Power Automate.

### 9. **Integration and APIs**
   - Provides REST APIs and SDKs for integration into applications.
   - Supports seamless integration with business workflows and systems.

### 10. **Security and Compliance**
   - Complies with industry standards for data privacy and security.
   - Offers role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption for secure data handling.

### 11. **Real-Time Processing**
   - Processes documents in real-time, enabling instant insights and automation.

### 12. **Customizable Output**
   - Outputs structured data in various formats (e.g., JSON) for easy downstream processing and integration.

# Estimating Work for Azure AI Document Intelligence

Below is a breakdown of the key aspects to consider:

---

## 1. **Understanding Requirements**
   - **Document Types**:
     - Identify the types of documents to be processed (e.g., invoices, receipts, forms, identity documents).
   - **Volume of Documents**:
     - Estimate the total number of documents to be processed on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis.
   - **Document Variability**:
     - Evaluate the complexity and variability of document layouts and formats.
   - **Languages**:
     - Determine the languages present in the documents.
   - **Output Requirements**:
     - Define the required data outputs (e.g., raw text, structured data, key-value pairs, tables).

---

## 2. **Project Scope**
   - **Prebuilt vs. Custom Models**:
     - Assess whether prebuilt models suffice or if custom models need to be trained.
   - **Data Labeling Needs**:
     - If custom models are required, estimate the time and resources needed for labeling training data.
   - **Integration Requirements**:
     - Identify the systems or workflows the solution will integrate with (e.g., ERP, CRM, RPA tools).

---

## 3. **Technical Considerations**
   - **Data Preparation**:
     - Evaluate the effort required to prepare documents for processing (e.g., scanning, cleaning).
   - **API Usage**:
     - Plan for API integrations and usage limits based on the estimated volume.
   - **Scalability**:
     - Determine if the solution will need to scale for peak workloads.
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Account for error handling, retries, and exception workflows.
   - **Data Security**:
     - Ensure compliance with data privacy and security requirements.

---

## 4. **Development Effort**
   - **Model Customization**:
     - Estimate time for creating and training custom models.
   - **Integration Development**:
     - Plan the effort required to integrate Azure AI Document Intelligence with other systems.
   - **Workflow Automation**:
     - Determine the complexity of automating document processing workflows.
   - **Testing**:
     - Allocate time for testing accuracy and performance.
   - **Optimization**:
     - Account for iterative improvements based on feedback.

---

## 5. **Infrastructure and Costs**
   - **Azure Resource Setup**:
     - Consider time for setting up Azure services (e.g., Azure Form Recognizer, storage, compute).
   - **Resource Scaling**:
     - Plan for potential scaling needs based on document volume.
   - **Cost Estimation**:
     - Calculate costs for processing documents using the Azure pricing calculator.
       - **Prebuilt Models**: Charged per page processed.
       - **Custom Models**: Includes charges for training, storage, and processing.
