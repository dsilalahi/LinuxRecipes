Critical metrics to keep an eye on for ensuring the health, performance, and reliability:

### 1. **CPU and Memory Usage**
   - **CPU Requests vs. Actual Usage**: Helps in understanding if your pods are over or under-provisioned.
   - **Memory Requests vs. Actual Usage**: Ensures that your pods have enough memory to function without being over-provisioned.

### 2. **Node Health**
   - **Node Status**: Monitors the health of each node in your cluster to ensure they are functioning correctly.
   - **Node Resource Utilization**: Tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage on each node.

### 3. **Pod Health**
   - **Pod Status**: Checks if pods are running, pending, or failed.
   - **Pod Restarts**: Monitors the number of times a pod has restarted, which can indicate stability issues.

### 4. **Network Metrics**
   - **Network Traffic**: Measures the amount of data being transferred in and out of your cluster.
   - **Network Latency**: Tracks the time it takes for data to travel across the network.

### 5. **Storage Metrics**
   - **Persistent Volume Utilization**: Monitors the usage of persistent storage volumes to ensure they are not over-utilized.

### 6. **Application Performance**
   - **Request Rate**: Measures the number of requests your application is handling.
   - **Error Rate**: Tracks the number of errors occurring in your application.
   - **Response Time**: Monitors how quickly your application is responding to requests.

### 7. **Cluster Events**
   - **Kubernetes Events**: Logs events related to your cluster, such as pod creation, deletion, and errors.

### 8. **Security Metrics**
   - **Audit Logs**: Tracks access and changes to your cluster to ensure compliance and security.
